Project Overview:
Predicting used car prices can be challenging due to numerous factors that influence a vehicle's value. In today’s automotive market, accurate pricing predictions help both buyers and sellers make informed decisions. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model estimating the selling price of used cars based on features such as brand, location, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.

Skills and Techniques:
* Programming Languages: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Machine Learning Techniques: Regression, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation
* Data Visualization: Scatter plots, Box plots, Correlation matrices

Project Details:
1) Problem Statement:
Predict the selling price of a used car based on multiple factors, including make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more.

Approach:
1) Data Collection: Acquired a dataset containing detailed information about used cars (e.g., kilometers driven, fuel type, engine power, ownership history).
2) Data Preprocessing: Cleaned data, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables.
3) Model Building: Implemented various regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4) Model Evaluation: Compared models using metrics such as RMSE, R-squared, and cross-validation scores.
5) Visualization: Created scatter plots, box plots, and feature importance charts to interpret model outputs.

Methodology:
1) Data Cleaning: Removed outliers, handled missing data.
2) Feature Engineering: Created new features (e.g., age of car, fuel efficiency).
3) Model Training: Applied algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost.
4) Evaluation: Assessed model performance using cross-validation.

Visualizations:
* Scatter plot: Predicted vs Actual prices
* Feature importance: Visualizing key predictors
* Box plot: Price distribution by brand and fuel type

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can effectively predict used car prices, improving decision-making for both buyers and sellers.
